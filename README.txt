JavaScript functionality--->

1st:
I implemented the 'filter table' functionality for the table on the Resources page. The table includes information about other websites on global warming. When users type a keyword in the search bar, if the keyword is included or matches the name of a website, the row including information of that website will be shown, and the other rows will be hidden. Nothing will be shown if the keyword is not found.


2nd:
I implemented the 'sort table' functionality for the table on the Resources page. When users click on the sort button below the table, the rows will be sorted by name in alphabetical order.


Form--->

I embedded a form in the Contact section for all three pages. Users can type into their first names, last names and comments.
